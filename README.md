Disease Prediction from Symptoms
This project predicts possible diseases based on symptoms selected by the user. It uses a machine learning model trained on a set of disease symptoms, applying the Naive Bayes classifier to diagnose diseases based on symptom patterns.

Project Overview
This application leverages machine learning to predict diseases based on user-selected symptoms. The GUI allows users to input symptoms, and the model outputs a predicted disease based on the input data.

Features
Symptom-based disease prediction using a Naive Bayes model.
User-friendly GUI for selecting symptoms and displaying predictions.
Real-time prediction accuracy feedback.
Installation
Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The key libraries used are pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and tkinter.

Run the Application: Execute the script to start the GUI:

bash
Copy code
python disease_prediction.py
Usage
Launch the application.
Select up to five symptoms from the drop-down menus.
Click on Predict Disease to see the predicted disease based on selected symptoms.
Dataset
Training Data: The model is trained on a dataset (Training.csv) that includes a variety of symptoms and corresponding diseases.
Testing Data: Testing is performed on a separate dataset (Testing.csv) to evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.
The datasets must include symptoms as columns and a final column labeled "prognosis" representing the disease.

Model
The model utilizes the Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) for prediction:

Training: The model is trained on the symptoms provided in the training dataset.
Testing: Accuracy is tested using a separate testing dataset.
Results
The model's accuracy on the test data is printed upon launching, which gives insight into prediction reliability. The achieved accuracy in current testing is around X% (replace this with your model's accuracy).

GUI Interface
The application includes a graphical interface built with Tkinter:

Symptom selection via drop-down menus.
Predict Disease button for real-time prediction.
Prediction display showing the name of the most likely disease based on symptoms.
